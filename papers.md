## Evidence of Language Decline in Terry Pratchett’s Writing: Effects of Posterior Cortical Atrophy on the Lexicon
*Term Paper for Language Processing Across the Lifespan, University of Freiburg im Breisgau*, 2021

This paper investigates how Terry Pratchett’s rare form of Alzheimer’s disease—Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA)—may have influenced his writing. Using corpus linguistic methods, the study compares two collections of his novels: one written before his 2007 diagnosis and one after. Three linguistic aspects were analyzed: vocabulary size, lexical repetition, and vagueness. Contrary to expectations and to findings from similar studies on other authors with dementia, Pratchett’s later works did not show a clear lexical decline. Instead, his type–token ratio and lexical diversity appeared to stabilize or even increase after diagnosis, while repetition and vague expressions decreased slightly. These results suggest that, rather than reflecting cognitive deterioration, Pratchett’s later language use may demonstrate a conscious effort to maintain stylistic richness and precision despite his illness. The study contributes to research on language and neurodegeneration by highlighting the complex relationship between creativity, self-awareness, and linguistic change in dementia.



## Metaphors We Politicize By
*Bachelor Thesis, University of Santiago de Compostela*, 2019

The Metaphor has been traditionally understood in the Western philosophical tradition as a rhetorical device
used in ornamentallanguage, mainly in literary contexts. In 1980 a new and revolutionary theory was put
forward by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson. In their work Metaphors We Uve By, the authors layout an
account of the metaphor as a conceptual and cognitive device which permeates the way we think, act and
interact with the world. For Lakoff and Johnson, metaphors are nota language phenomenon but rather a
phenomenon of thought, which allow us to conceptualize domains that we could not be able to develop
without them; metaphors are nota mere literary device but rather they pervade our everyday thoughts and
affect our interna! representations and vis ion of the world.
In works like Don't Think of an Elephant (2004) and Moral Politics (2002) Lakoff applies his theory of the
cognitive metaphor to politicallanguage and explores the intersection of cognitive and political science. The
metaphors used in political discourse, argues Lakoff, are not neutral but rather signs of a deeply ingrained
conceptual system that has direct repercussions on our social and política! thought.
The aim of this dissertation will be twofold. Firstly 1 will analyze the theoretical framework of the metaphor for
which 1 will offer a review of the available written literature, from Lakoff and Johnson to authors like Zoltan
Kovecses, Murray Knowles and Rosamund Moon among others. Secondly, 1 will employ a corpus-based
methodology to elaborate a practica! study of the conceptual metaphor theory applied to the analysis of the
socio-political speech of one or more conservative politicians. My goal will ultimately be to evidence the
cognitive significance of the metaphor through the examination of the language used by modern-day
conservative politicians.
