### Evidence of Language Decline in Terry Pratchett’s Writing: Effects of Posterior Cortical Atrophy on the Lexicon
*Term Paper for Language Processing Across the Lifespan, University of Freiburg im Breisgau*, 2021

This paper investigates how Terry Pratchett’s rare form of Alzheimer’s disease—Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA)—may have influenced his writing. Using corpus linguistic methods, the study compares two collections of his novels: one written before his 2007 diagnosis and one after. Three linguistic aspects were analyzed: vocabulary size, lexical repetition, and vagueness. Contrary to expectations and to findings from similar studies on other authors with dementia, Pratchett’s later works did not show a clear lexical decline. Instead, his type–token ratio and lexical diversity appeared to stabilize or even increase after diagnosis, while repetition and vague expressions decreased slightly. These results suggest that, rather than reflecting cognitive deterioration, Pratchett’s later language use may demonstrate a conscious effort to maintain stylistic richness and precision despite his illness. The study contributes to research on language and neurodegeneration by highlighting the complex relationship between creativity, self-awareness, and linguistic change in dementia.

### “Welcome to Hell”: A Critical Discourse Approach to The Media Representations of Demonstrators During the G20 Protests in Hamburg
*Term Paper for Practical Foundations of Linguistic Research, University of Freiburg im Breisgau*, 2020

This paper analyzes how mainstream and alternative media portrayed demonstrators during the 2017 G20 protests in Hamburg. Combining Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Corpus Linguistics techniques such as collocation analysis, it investigates lexical patterns that reveal ideological framing in news coverage. The study finds that mainstream outlets tended to depict protesters through negative or violent associations, while alternative media emphasized their motives and social concerns. These contrasting narratives expose how ownership, political alignment, and journalistic conventions shape the public perception of dissent. Ultimately, the research highlights how discourse can legitimize or delegitimize collective action and shows the media’s powerful role in constructing social meaning around protest.

### The Use Of Superlatives And Degree Boosters In Jane Austen’s Novels: Applying Corpus Methods To The Study Of Literature
*Term Paper for Corpus-Linguistic Methods, University of Freiburg im Breisgau*, 2020

This paper explores how Jane Austen’s distinctive irony and caricature might manifest linguistically through her use of exaggerated or intensified expressions. Using corpus-linguistic methods, the study compares Austen’s novels with those of her female contemporaries to determine whether her writing contains a higher frequency of superlatives, maximizers, and degree boosters. Results indicate that Austen’s style relies heavily on intensifying language, supporting the idea that her characteristic wit and parody are reinforced at the grammatical level. By blending literary analysis with computational tools, the paper demonstrates how corpus methods can illuminate subtle stylistic tendencies, bridging the gap between quantitative language research and traditional literary criticism.

### Greenhouses And Submarine Sandwiches: A Look Into The Creativity and Predictability Of Noun-noun Figurative Compounds
*Term Paper for Morphology, University of Freiburg im Breisgau*, 2020

This study investigates how speakers interpret figurative noun–noun compounds such as greenhouse or submarine sandwich, focusing on their transparency and predictability. Building on cognitive-linguistic theories of metaphor and compositionality, an experiment was conducted in which bilingual English speakers rated the interpretability of 14 potential compounds. The results suggest that figurative or “exocentric” compounds are not always opaque; many are readily understood through conceptual metaphors linking their components. These findings challenge the long-held assumption that such compounds are semantically unpredictable, showing instead that metaphor and metonymy provide systematic, cognitively accessible routes to meaning. The study emphasizes the creative yet patterned nature of figurative compounding in English.

### A Chinese Virus? Uncovering The Linguistic and Political Implications of Naming a Disease Through a Corpus-Study of Covid-19
*Term Paper for Distant Reading, University of Freiburg im Breisgau*, 2020

This paper examines how the naming of Covid-19 reflects broader linguistic and sociopolitical dynamics. Through a corpus-based analysis of terms such as Covid-19, Wuhan virus, and Kung-Flu, it traces how scientific, geographical, and politicized names emerged and competed in public discourse. Drawing on frameworks from onomastics and socio-onomastics, the study explores whether these labels function as proper names and how they shape public perception. The findings reveal that while official naming conventions aim for neutrality, popular and media usage often reintroduce stigma. The paper studies how naming is never a neutral act but a linguistic process that may reflect biases.

### Metaphors We Politicize By
*Bachelor Thesis, University of Santiago de Compostela*, 2019

This dissertation examines the role of metaphor as a fundamental tool of thought rather than a mere stylistic feature of language. Building on George Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s Metaphors We Live By (1980), which redefined metaphor as a central mechanism of human cognition, the study explores how conceptual metaphors shape not only our linguistic expressions but also our perception of reality. The research first outlines the theoretical foundations of Conceptual Metaphor Theory through the works of Lakoff, Johnson, Kövecses, Knowles, and Moon, among others. It then applies corpus-based methods to analyze the use of conceptual metaphors in the socio-political discourse of contemporary conservative politicians. The findings aim to demonstrate how metaphorical framing in political language reflects and reinforces underlying ideological worldviews, revealing the profound cognitive and social impact of metaphor in shaping political thought and communication.
